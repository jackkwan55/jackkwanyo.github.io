		<header> <h1>Understanding Gunner</h1>

		<p>
		Over the years, Gunner has had many passions. Skateboarding, ping-pong, parkour, and gun-wielding. This kid 
		has gone through a plethora of mind sets, and wouldn't be where he is today without them. Each passion he has gotten in to 
		has brought him through a particular discipline. Gunner developed strong initiative to practice what ever it was that he was into at that time 
		every day. He has a strong heart, and understands the principle of hard work.  </p>

		<p>
		Being the only child with four sisters, Gunner 
		had to immediately learn how to grow up brotherless. No one to beat him down, nothing. His sisters had always been something he 
		struggled with growing up, getting into petty fights, etc. But Gunner grew to respect his sisters and care for them deeply. Along with his sisters Gunner also
		had his most beloved dog, Nonnie. Nonnie has been an especially important part of Gunner's life. Always there for him in times of cuddles and by his bed when 
		he is sleeping at night. </p>

<p> As you can see from Gunner's early age he has always been a crazy fun kid. Spinning on his head, jumping around the house, and doing whatever 
action packed thing he wanted to do. Gunner was born this way. </p>
